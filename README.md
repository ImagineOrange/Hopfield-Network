# Hopfield-Network
An implementation of a Binary Hopfield Network


The hopfield_mnist.py file contains the Hopfield Network Class, and an experiment which displays 
the function of the network using the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. 

The helper_functions.py file contains some helper functions, such as an image prep function called setup, 
a random distortion function, and another useful function.

This repo is helper code for the medium article located at https://medium.com/towards-data-science/hopfield-networks-neural-memory-machines-4c94be821073
